# Hi, I'm Roland 👋

## Coding from the Pacific 🌊💻

I'm a software developer living on a sailboat with my family. Most of my work happens off-grid, powered by solar energy while cruising the Pacific Ocean.

## What I Do 🚀

- 👀 Interested in open source software and technology solutions that make a positive impact.
- 🌱 Nearly 30 years of experience in software architecture, team leadership, and development.
- ☁️ Former Principal at AWS, where I focused on the Rust programming language.
- ☁️ Former SOA architect at Microsoft, where I helped launch v1 of Azure back in 2009.
- ☁️ Current consultant-for-hire, open-source maintainer and Microsoft Startup Accelerator participant building [ntangler](https://github.com/GovCraft/ntangler).
- 🦀 Rust enthusiast, always exploring its potential for efficient, secure systems.
- 🤖 Keen on AI and its applications across different fields.

## My Background 🗺️

I've worked in various tech roles over the years, from leading teams to architecting solutions. Now, I'm applying that experience to create robust, adaptable code – all while navigating the challenges and joys of a nautical lifestyle.
