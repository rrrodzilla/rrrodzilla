- 👋 Hi, I’m @rrrodzilla.  I live on a sailboat with my family.  Most of my code is created off-grid with solar power on the Pacific Ocean.
- 👀 I’m interested in open source software and solutions that make the world a better place.
- 🌱 I’ve been architecting technology solutions, leading software delivery teams and hacking code for over 25 years.
- ☁️ Former Principal @ AWS focused on the Rust programming language and now owner and founder of Govcraft.
