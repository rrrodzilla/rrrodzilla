- 👋 Hi, I’m @rrrodzilla.  For the past decade I lived a simpler life on a sailboat with my family of 5, spending the past couple years cruising the Pacific Coast of Mexico and writing software for myself and others.  Now my family has relocated back to Seattle in order to care for one of my best friends who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal illness called [Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA)](https://www.multiplesystematrophy.org/about-msa/).  You can help support MY family being able to caregive for him and HIS family by supporting my open source work.  Thanks for checking things out!
- 👀 I’m interested in open source software and solutions that make the world a better place.
- 🌱 I’ve been architecting technology solutions, leading software delivery teams and hacking code for over 25 years.

I've helped ship a few mainstream products and a bunch of large service delivery platforms for very large governments/telcos/retail/airlines/etc

Some notable projects | Role | Shipped
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Microsoft LiveMeeting (breakout rooms feature) | Architect | 2004
Turkcell Service Delivery Platform (Turkey) | SOA and Solution Architect | 2005
Telstra Service Delivery Platform (Australia) | SOA and Solution Architect | 2006
Microsoft Dynamics 2008 | Dev lead (SRM component) | 2008
Microsoft Azure v1 | TAP Architect | 2009

Currently I'm enjoying building backend solutions with Rust and front-end solutions with Vue.  My favorite languages in order of preference:

Language | Years Experience
------------ | -------------
Rust | About a year
Python | 4 years
C# | 21 years
JavaScript | 25 years (includes evolutionary stacks such as React/Vue/et al)

I'm proficient in a variety of other languages, stacks, frameworks, data storage platforms, and technologies but the four above are my favorite to work in.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of open-source initiatives that focus on the greater social good or flexible, remote contracts to enable my family to continue focusing our efforts on caregiving for my best friend and his family during their time of need.
