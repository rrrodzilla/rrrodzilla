# Hi, I'm Roland ðŸ‘‹

I'm an entrepreneur, open-source contributor, and technologist with nearly 30 years of experience in business, software architecture, and engineering. I live and work on a sailboat with my family and 3 cats, using solar energy to stay off-grid while cruising the Pacific Ocean.

## What I Do

- **Open Source & Technology:** Passionate about creating and maintaining useful open-source projects that help society.
- **Experience:**
  - **Software Architecture & Leadership:** Nearly three decades in designing and leading software teams.
  - **AWS:** Former Principal managing Rust programming language projects globally.
  - **Microsoft:** Former SOA Architect, helped launch Azure v1 in 2009.

- **Current Projects:**
  - **Govcraft:** Spending all of my time these days providing expertise in secure, safe software development, ML integration, and cloud optimization.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Rust:** Expert in its use for efficient and secure systems. 
  - **Machine Learning:** Using professionally since 2015 across different fields.
  - **Everything Else:** If you can Google it, I've likely got experience with it in some form or fashion. I only count "experience" as I've installed it, run it, managed it, built it, configured it or some combination thereof. I'm a prolific learner and the projects I've worked on are too numerous to count.
