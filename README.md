# Hi, I'm Roland 👋

I started programming in BASIC forty years ago when I was eight on a TRS-80 from Radio Shack...It's been all downhill from there.

I'm an entrepreneur, open-source contributor/maintainer, and freelance tech consultant living on a sailboat with my family. Most of my work happens off-grid, powered by solar energy while cruising the Pacific Ocean.

## What I Do 🚀

- 🌱 Nearly 30 years of experience in software architecture, team leadership, and software engineering.
- ☁️ Former Principal at AWS, where I managed the Rust programming language globally.
- ☁️ Former SOA architect at Microsoft, where I helped launch v1 of Azure back in 2009.
- ☁️ Current consultant-for-hire, open-source maintainer and Microsoft Startup Accelerator participant building [ntangler](https://github.com/GovCraft/ntangler).
- 🦀 Rust enthusiast, always exploring its potential for efficient, secure systems.
