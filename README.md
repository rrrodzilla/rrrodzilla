# Hey, I'm Roland 👋

I'm a software developer with nearly 30 years of experience building things. These days I live on a sailboat with my family and 3 cats, cruising the Pacific and running everything on solar power. It's a pretty good setup.

## What I'm Up To

I spend most of my time building and maintaining open-source projects over at [Govcraft](https://github.com/Govcraft). It's just me—no team, no investors, no corporate backing. Just a guy on a boat writing code.

**Some things I've built:**
- **[acton-service](https://github.com/Govcraft/acton-service)** - Production-grade Rust microservice framework
- **[acton-reactive](https://github.com/Govcraft/acton-reactive)** - Actor-based reactive framework for Rust
- **[rust-docs-mcp-server](https://github.com/Govcraft/rust-docs-mcp-server)** - MCP server for querying Rust crate documentation

## Background

I've been doing this for a while:
- **AWS** - Former Principal managing Rust programming language projects globally
- **Microsoft** - Former SOA Architect, helped launch Azure v1 back in 2009
- **Rust** - My main thing these days. I love it for building efficient, secure systems.
- **ML** - Been using it professionally since 2015

If you can Google it, I've probably installed it, run it, built it, or broken it at some point.

## Support My Work

If you find any of my projects useful, consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/Govcraft). It helps keep the boat batteries charged and lets me spend more time on open source instead of consulting gigs.
